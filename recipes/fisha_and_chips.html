    <h1>Fish and chips</h1>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    <img src="images/fish.jpg" alt="fish">
    <p>This fish and chips recipe calls for cod,
        which is the most traditional <br> choice because of its mild flavor and tender texture. Other popular options
        include haddock and pollock. </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <Ul>
        <li>4 large potatoes, peeled and cut into strips
        </li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour
        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder
        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt
        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper
        </li>
        <li>1 cup milk
        </li>
        <li>1 egg
        </li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying
        </li>
        <li>1 Â½ pounds cod fillets
        </li>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li> Place sliced potatoes in a medium bowl and cover with cold water.</li>
            <li> Mix flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper together in a separate medium bowl. Add milk and egg; stir
                until batter is smooth. Let stand for 20 minutes. </li>
            <li> Meanwhile, heat oil in a large pot or electric skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>

                on all sides; drain on paper towels. Monitor oil temperature, increasing the heat as needed to maintain
